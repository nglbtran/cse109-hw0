I think cheating in a course undermines the reputation of Lehigh University, and it also makes a bad mindset of students who got into Lehigh that it is easy to cheat.
When students cheat, it devalue the rigorous academic standards of Lehigh University. The harder accomplishments of honest students, more efforts that students need 
to try hard. Also, harder degree potentially impacts the job career finding which is more important than the scores. Overall, I think cheating not only badly impact 
cheaters but also the fairness of studying environment.
