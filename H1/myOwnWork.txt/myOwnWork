Online resources would be useful and helpful for students when they use it in right ways: try to debugging, find and solve coding practice problems, learn deeply 
about any coding perspective and concepts, etc.

It would be no longer students' works when they try to use AI tools to complete assignments and copy all of them without understanding and knowing clearly the answers

Online sources would be an amazing source to approach and develop skills when we develop software program.
